For more detailed information about each of the parts of this starter code, check out the [`INFO.md`](INFO.md) file

## Prerequisites

If you don't have them already, you'll need to install Node.js/NPM and Git:
- Node.js + NPM - install [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) (we highly recommend using at least Node 18.0.0 + NPM 8.6.0)
   - You can choose to install via the command line under "Package Manager", or download an installer under "Prebuilt Installer"
   - Node and NPM are installed together
- Git - install [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repo on to your computer. You can do so with the [desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/), or in a terminal with the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/huang0h/c4c-challenge-sample.git
```
2. In a terminal, run `npm install` **at the root of this project** to install the required packages
3. Run `npm run dev` **at the root of this project** to start the app locally
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the website
    
    4a. The backend will be available at `http://localhost:4000`

## Starting the Application

## Overview

## Design Decisions

## Reflection
- ### What I learned
  -
- ### What I would have done differently with more time
  -
- ### Issues?
  - The biggest issue I faced was that I had no experience with React and very minimal experience with Javascript. Because of this, I felt quite overwhelmed at first but I set out to learn as much as I could within the past few days. I did this by watching numereous online videos and read up on React's documentation and tutorials on the React website. 
  - Another main issue currently is that I'll be on vacation fom June 5th-13th, which is right up to the deadline for the project. I understand I'm losing a good amount of time due to this so what I've done is devote as much of my free time as I could these past few days, aside from work, to complete the tech challenge. In addition, I anticipate to spend more time in coming days as well as on the plane to fully optimize the final outcome.
