## Starting the Application

## Overview

## Design Decisions

## Reflection
- # What I learned
  -
- # What I would have done differently with more time
  -
- # Issues?
  - I'd say the first issue I ran into off the bat was being overwhelmed with the idea of tackling this project in a week with little to no experience or knowledge of the technologies required for the project. I faced this by setting out a timeline of spending a few days learning as much as I could while also keeping in mind the goal of the project. I noticed that the project required quite a deep understanding of React which was something I was not familiar with at all. 
  - Time issue: I'll be on vacation from June 5th-13th so I'm losing quite a lot of time that I could've spent making a much better outcome. To tackle this issue, I spent as much time as I could during my free time working on the project since it was sent out.
